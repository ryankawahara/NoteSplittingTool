# NoteSplittingTool
Takes in a list of comma dilineated notes and splits them into a new row. Used by Instinctual VFX during VFX work on "Don't Look Up."

# Instructions:

Make a copy of this sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cvsqf9ccWsck4dAUFcg4GPt-CUnSv6LKGgylIwxDTnA/edit?usp=sharing) and be sure to allow the script to be copied too
Copy and past the sample input (excluding "ID" and "Body") into columns A and B
The comma delimited notes in "body" will be separated while maintining the ID when the blue box is clicked
NOTE: The sheet will ask you to grant permissions. You  must do this to allow the script to modify the sheet.

NOTE: The "COMP" and "READ" are from the use case at Instinctual, but they can be easily deleted.
